							<h1>Letter Games</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p> In 2021 Josh Wardle's now famous word game 'Wordle' shot to popularity. Millions of users 
							were all engaged in playing the daily five-letter word puzzle. Colleagues and friends would share the number of guesses 
							it took them to find the solution, and the iconic green, gray, and yellow squares became a household visual. Later, the game 
							would be purchased by the New York Times and put on display with other iconic daily puzzles like Sudoku or the Crossword.  
							Internet investigators quickly observed that the entirety of the game's solutions were listed in order in the source code, directly searchable with an F12 page-inspect. 
							With a transparent answer key, each aspect of Wordle's design were fully apparent. Just 2309 words in a list updating each day, one at a time. Six guesses with immediate color-coded feedback. 
							Something so simple, yet enough to captivate millions.</p>
							<p> I thought it would be fun to investigate how these words might have been selected or how one could master guess selection in Wordle. To do 
							so, I will take a deeper look at the available list of words and compare them to the acceptable list of 5-letter words from an even more famous 
							word game: 'Scrabble'. Using the Collins Scrabble Official Dictionary from 2019, how dissimilar are the words chosen by Josh Wardle to the near complete set accepted by Scrabble (n = 12792)? 
							Do trends in the data allow us to infer anything about the design of his list? What might these patterns reveal about the structure of the English language? Lastly, what clues can I take from this to be a better Wordle player?</p>
							<h2>Letter Distributions</h2>
							<p>
							One of the first things we can look at is how evenly the letters in Wordle solutions are distributed. Should we expect that the words will be 
							distributed similarly to the whole population of possible words? 
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/letter_games_1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
							<b>Figure A</b> shows the distribution of all letters for the complete Wordle list as well as all five-letter words for Scrabble. The histgram's x-axis is every character in the English language,
							 and the y-axis is the proportional occurence of total character usage. The height of all like-colored bars sum to 1. Colors are split by word list. There are relatively 
							"obvious" peaks where we might expect. Letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'r', 's', 't' are all quite common whereas 'j', 'q', 'x', and 'z' are seldom used.
							This all makes intuitive sense when we think about the characters we use in everyday words. 
							<br>
							<b>Figure B</b> shows a similar distribution to <b>Figure A</b>, except this histogram is the proportional occurence of only the <b>first</b> letter of each word.
							Notice how <b>Figure B</b> has a very distinct shape compared to <b>Figure A</b>. Much of this is because <b>Figure A</b> is dominated by vowels which are present in every word whereas the first letter of a word has 
							no bias or predisposition to be a vowel. Now, consonants like 'b', 'c', 'p', 's', and 't' make up a much larger share of the overall pie. Additionally, 'x' has shrunk to an almost insignificant value 
							because exceptionally few words start with x. Contrarily, q's share has grown because q is far more likely to start a word then to be somewhere in the middle.
							<br>
							You might be noticing that the blue and the orange columns are relatively disparate for certain letters. These differences show changes in Josh Wardle's word selection 
							compared to the "complete" set of five-letter words. At this scale it can be hard to see how much the proportions have changed for each letter. A better way to visualize this data 
							is to look at the percent difference in values for each letter: 100*(Wordle-Scrabble)/Scrabble.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/letter_games_2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
							<b>Figure C</b> shows the percent differences for these letters as described above for all letters in a word. Red bars indicate that the letter is proportionately more likely to occur 
							in a Wordle solution than in the population of all five-letter words. Blue bars mean these characters are disproportionately scarce in Wordle. Clearly scarce letters in Wordle are 'j', 'k', 's', 'x', and 'z'. 
							<br>
							I could posit a couple guesses as to why these might be more rare in the Wordle game. For 's', it could be that the Scrabble list contains a high number of plural 4-letter nouns that Wardle is intentionally 
							attempting to avoid. The game might feel biased towards plurarity if Wardle did not factor this into his selection, and everyone's first guess would end with 's'. As for why j, k, x, and z are more rare, it might 
							be that Wardle attempted to exclude very difficult words as to not discourage the player. For the letters that gained proportional useage in Wordle, I do not have many theories except that Wardle may 
							have attempted to balance the game through character selection as that may lead to a more rounded player experience if more letters had a similar chance of occuring.
							<br>
							<b>Figure D</b> is very similar to <b>Figure C</b> only it shows the percent difference for the first letter of words. Much of the story is similar to the previous figure and relies on the same speculation. Why 
							x, y, and z are so much more rare in Wordle could be that users know very few, if any, five-letter words starting with these letters, and Wardle did not want the game to be too challenging? I would love to hear your theories 
							if you have a another idea about these differences.
							</p>
							<h2>Expanding to All Positions</h2>
							<p><span class="image rightM"><img src="images/letter_games_3.png" alt="" /></span>
							The previous information is only partially helpful in formulating a Wordle strategy. To better inform strategy, we need to look at all character positions in the five-letter word. 
							A good way to show information-dense 2-dimensional data is with a heatmap as shown in <b>Figure E</b> and <b>Figure F</b>. Here the characters are displayed from a to z on the y-axis while 
							character position is on the x-axis. Shades from black to yellow are assigned in increasing likelihood to each square based on proportional occurence of that letter at that location. Each row will sum to 1. 
							For example, in <b>Figure E</b>, the 'b' character squares from left to right are: [0.62, 0.06, 0.20, 0.08, 0.04]. Therefore, if b is in the word, it has a 62% chance of being in the first position, and is almost never in the last position (4%).
							<br>
							Any square between red and yellow shows a letter that has strong bias towards occuring in a particular position, and uniform purple across positions indicates that the letter is well-distributed by position. 
							Some clear standouts are b, f, j, and q, which are all likely to start the word while y and k are far more likely to end a word. Other interesting letters are u which is most likely seen in the 2nd position (maybe after q?) and z 
							which is seen in the 4th position, potentially followed by an e or y. 
							<br>
							<b>Figure F</b> combines the data in <b>Figure E</b> with the principals of <b>Figures C & D </b>. Blue squares show letter positions that are less likely in Wordle than in all Scrabble five-letter words, and red squares 
							show the opposite - where a letter is more common in Wordle than in the "complete" list. Clear negative trends are the last letters of j, q, s, u, and v. Many of these are likely because words ending in these characters would be 
							very difficult guesses, and s could be due to reducing the amount of plurality in the word set. Letters y and k are less likely to occur in any position except the last position, and s is the exact opposite - showing up more often in 
							the first four positions and less frequently in the last. Do any of these surprise you, or are there other fun patterns you can identify?
							</p>
							<h2>Information Density Overload</h2>
							<p><span class="image leftM"><img src="images/letter_games_4.png" alt="" /></span>
							What other information could be helfpul in informing guesses? One event is if you know one or more of the letters and are making subsequent guesses. It could be useful to know which characters 
							are most likely to follow another letter. In <b>Figure G</b> both axes are ordered from a-z where the y-axis is the fist letter and the x-axis is the subsequent letter in the word. The data set used is the complete 
							set from Scrabble (I didn't want to give too much information away). Cells colored black have <b>zero</b> occurrence in the complete English language of 5-letter words. If you look at column q you will see most of the column is black 
							because q can only follow a very select few characters (s, i, and rarely a). 
							<br>
							Colors from blue to red increasing in color temperature show the likelihood of a letter following another letter in a five-letter word. Every box in one row sums to 1. 
							The colorbar is normalized differently around the midpoint (0.05) to show a greater range in colors for variation less than 5%. The bar stops at 0.25 so that strong outliers do not bias 
							the overall colormap scale. There is one cell on this grid that completely saturates all colors and obscures most meaning if the colorbar is uniformly scaled from 0-1, can you tell which 
							letter pair that is? 
							<br>
							The colormap is information dense, and at a brief glimpse out of focus it looks like a vibrant Piet Mondrian piece with an almost city-block pattern of color. A few colorful north-south avenues 
							stand out to the eye: a, e, i, o, u, and y. It is no surprise that a common subsequent letter for most letters is a vowel. Conversely, f, h, j, q, v, and z all have quite dark 
							horizontal profiles indicating that they are very selective about the letters they can precede.
							
							<br>
							The diagonal of the figure shows relative liklihoods of duplicate letters. Some letters that more commonly come in tandem are thus f, o, and z. 
							Looking between the vowel color walls, a few consonant pairs of warmer colors are visible. A few that stand out after a little scanning are: 'ch', 'ng', 'ck', 'st' and nearly anything 
							followed by an s.
							
							</p>
							<h2>Supplemental Fun</h2>
							<p>
							One of the more challenging components from Wordle's design is that duplicate letters are sometimes difficult to identify 
							as a single green or yellow square provides no indication about potential repeats. Additionally, guessing a duplicate letter does not maximize the amount of 
							information provided in each guess. Therefore, words with fewer than 5 characters are less conventional and certainly less than optimal guesses. Did the author do anything to 
							make these words more or less likely than a more complete dictionary?
							</p>
							<p>
							In a fairly simple search, checking the length of the set of each word provides information about how many distinct letters are in a word.
							For 12972 acceptable Scrabble words, 64.2% have all distinct letters. However, for 2309 Wordle words, 67.6% have distinct characters. Can this 3.4% be attributed 
							to pure chance? <br>
							A Chi-squared test of these two populations yields p = 0.003 which is significant at every normal null hypothesis p value. Therefore, 
							the frequency of duplicate-letter words in Wordle is statistically different than the population of Scrabble words. Whether 
							the author achieved this result by selectively removing duplicate-letter words or if duplicate-letter words are more obscure and would be less familiar to the player-base 
							is still unclear.
							</p>
							
							<pre><code>
# Dintinct Letters
UWords = [[],[],[],[]]
AWords = [[],[],[],[]]
for word in WordleList:
    UWords[len(set(word))-2].append(word)
for word in FullList:
    AWords[len(set(word))-2].append(word)

print(f'Words with only 2 letters: {AWords[0]}')
LetterCountProportions = [[],[],[],[]]
for j in range(4):
    LetterCountProportions[j] = [100*len(UWords[j])/sum(len(x) for x in UWords),100*len(AWords[j])/sum(len(x) for x in AWords)]
print(f'Proportional Breakdown by Number of Distinct Letters')
print(f'([2 [Wordle, Scrabble]], [3], [4], [5]): {LetterCountProportions}')
							
							</code></pre>
							
							
							<p> While Wordle only has one word with two distinct letters ('mamma'), Scrabble accepts nine ('susus', 'peepe', 'nanna', 'taata', 'ayaya', 'mamma', 'anana', 'esses', and 'cocco'). These words are written with a 
							word length to character ratio of 2.5 whereas a word with completely distinct characters has a ratio of 1. With the complete scrabble dictionary available 
							for our curiosities, are there other words 15 characters or fewer with a higher ratio than 2.5? What about the longest words with a ratio of 1? Any guesses?
							To determine these words, the following code was used: </p>
							<pre><code>
							
# Supplemental: Highest Ratio of total length to distinct letters for any length word:
maxlength = 11
for j, word in enumerate(CollinsList):
    if len(word)/len(set(word)) >= 3.0: print(f'{word}; {len(word)/len(set(word))}')
    if len(word)/len(set(word)) == 1.0 and len(word) >= maxlength:
        print(f'{word}; {len(word)/len(set(word))}')
        maxlength = len(word)
							
							</code></pre>
							
							<p>
							The yield? <br>
							<br>
							There were 21 words with a length to character ratio of 3:<br>
							Antitrinitarian, Araara, Ataata, Beebee, Booboo, Coocoo, Deeded, Doodoo, Kinnikinnick, Mmm, Muumuu, Sasararas, Sassarara,
							Seeresses, Serenenesses, Sesses, Sestettes, Sleeplessnesses, Weewee, Zoozoo, Zzz.<br>
							I would debate many of these words if you attempted to play them in a game of Scrabble against me, but fortunately there is a cut-and-dry
							dictionary that would abritrate that challenge.</p>
							
							<p>There were only 3 words with a ratio greater than 3:<br>
							Senselessness: 3.25<br>
							Sassararas: 3.33<br>
							Senselessnesses: 3.75</p>
							
							<p>Of all the high ratio words, I think my favorite is Kinnikinnick, a smoking mixture used by Native tribes. It is one 'c' away from 2nd place.</p>
							
							<p>There were 2 words with a ratio of 1 and a length of 15, meaning that all 15 characters are distinct:<br>
							Dermatoglyphics - N. Study of ridge patterns on skin, typically on hands and feet.<br>
							Uncopyrightable - Adj. Protected by copyright.</p>
							
							<h3>Additional Data Exercises</h3>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Consider if the 2309 ordered words show human bias in ordering - for instance if there are a disproportionate amount 
							of "similar" subsequent words to random chance. Similar words might be words that start with the same letter or words that contain the same vowels.</li>
								<li>The length:character ratio explored in the supplemental section uses a data-set only up to 15 characters in length. Are these words replaced 
							with longer words if words with more characters are included in the dataset?</li>
							</ul>
